# Dataset of tweets in English and Spanish about the stance on COVID-19 vaccines

This dataset contains tweets in both English and Spanish related to COVID-19 vaccines, collected from users on Twitter between 2020 and 2022. The tweets capture a wide range of opinions, with a focus on sentiments both in favor of and against the vaccines. These posts provide insights into the public's views, concerns, and reactions during a critical period of the global pandemic.

The dataset includes user-generated content expressing support for the vaccines, discussing their safety, efficacy, and importance in combating the pandemic. It also features tweets from users who express skepticism, fear, or opposition to the vaccines, citing concerns about side effects, government policies, or mistrust in pharmaceutical companies.

This bilingual collection can be useful for analyzing social attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccination, detecting misinformation, and understanding the influence of language on public opinion. The data provides a rich resource for researchers studying the social and linguistic dimensions of the global vaccine discourse.

## Data protection

For data protection reasons, these tweets have been dehydrated, meaning that the dataset only provides the ID of each Twitter post.

To be able to hydrate them, it is necessary to use the Twitter API to obtain the data through the platform itself.
