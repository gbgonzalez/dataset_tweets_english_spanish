# CURMIS4th Data Management Plan of the Project “Machine learning-based models to detect and curb Health misinformation on social media

## CURMIS4th: Semantic resources 

These datasets contain tweets in both English and Spanish related to COVID-19 vaccines, collected from users on Twitter between 2020 and 2022. The tweets capture a wide range of opinions, with a focus on sentiments both in favor of and against the vaccines. These posts provide insights into the public's views, concerns, and reactions during a critical period of the global pandemic.

The dataset includes user-generated content expressing support for the vaccines, discussing their safety, efficacy, and importance in combating the pandemic. It also features tweets from users who express skepticism, fear, or opposition to the vaccines, citing concerns about side effects, government policies, or mistrust in pharmaceutical companies.

In addition to this, a third dataset of Reddit posts has been incorporated, focusing on discussions related to mental health. This dataset includes posts from various Reddit communities, such as r/mentalhealth, r/depression, and r/anxiety, spanning from 2020 to 2023. The posts provide valuable insights into individuals’ experiences with mental health challenges, coping mechanisms, and the broader societal conversations around mental wellness. Topics range from personal stories and support-seeking behavior to debates on mental health awareness, treatments, and stigmas.

These three datasets—focused two of then on the global pandemic and other on mental health—provide complementary insights into critical areas of contemporary public discourse. Together, they offer a unique opportunity for comparative analysis of how individuals engage with health-related issues online, the role of social media in shaping opinions, and the ways in which public perceptions of health are influenced by both global crises and personal experiences.

This bilingual and multi-platform collection can be useful for analyzing social attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccination, detecting misinformation, understanding the influence of language on public opinion, and exploring the evolving conversation around mental health. The combined data provides a rich resource for researchers studying social and linguistic dimensions across health topics. 


## Data protection

For data protection reasons, these tweets have been dehydrated, meaning that the dataset only provides the ID of each Twitter post.

To be able to hydrate them, it is necessary to use the Twitter API to obtain the data through the platform itself.

The Reddit posts doesn't contain user information, the information in this dataset only contain posts information and respective metadata.
